# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

This project analyzes the Amazon Music Reviews with the following method:
- Uses PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. 
- Uses PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. 
- Summarizes the analysis to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.
